// randomly pick a file and Verify


    ls -la /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key

find / -user cloud_user     (cloud_user = userName) 


- Find all the files owned by particular user, in a particular directory


find /etc -user root | more     (root = userName, /etc = directorName) 


- Find file by permission

// I want to find Everything in /usr/bin directory by All permission by owner and

// Go to root
sudo su
find /usr/bin -perm 755


// Take a look at the actual permission of /usr/bin
ls -la /usr/bin

ls -la "text.txt"       (text.txt=fileName)
-rw-r--r-- 1 cloud_user cloud_user 0 Sep 24 16:45 test.txt

sudo find / -name "test.txt" -exec chmod 700 {} \;
// 'exec' is for execution command, here executing chmod, {}\; = place holder 
// Verify this

ls -la "test.txt" 
-rwx------ 1 cloud_user cloud_user 0 Sep 24 16:45 test.txt
// ok


- Change back to previous level permission

sudo find / -name "test.txt" -exec chmod 644 {} \;
